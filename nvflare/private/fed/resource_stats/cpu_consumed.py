"""One-boundary CPU accounting for a job execution process.

On Unix, SELF covers the process and its threads; CHILDREN covers only
terminated children that have been waited for, including descendants only
when every intervening process waited. No site-parent CPU or cgroup-wide
counter is used. This module does not sample or change worker teardown.
