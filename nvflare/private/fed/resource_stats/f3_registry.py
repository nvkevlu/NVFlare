"""Per-job :class:`F3Counter` ownership for a long-lived parent process.

A job process (SJ/CJ) only ever runs one job, so it can own a single
process-global counter. A parent process (SP: the root server; CP: a client
parent) is long-lived and handles many jobs over its lifetime -- often
concurrently on the server side -- so it needs one counter per job_id, kept
alive from job start through finalization and discarded afterward. This is
that per-job registry; it owns no traffic-classification logic itself (that
lives at the trusted NVFlare call sites that will use ``get()``).
