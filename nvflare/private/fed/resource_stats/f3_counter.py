"""Thread-safe, process-local F3 accounting for one job.

F3 counts originating logical sends, not transport frames or intermediary
forwarding hops. A trusted call site admits an included operation before it
starts, then either completes it after the transport accepts the operation or
abandons it when acceptance fails. The accounting API never owns or wraps
the send, so an observability failure cannot change send behaviour.

The counter has a one-way ``collecting`` -> ``closing`` -> ``frozen`` state
machine. Closing stops new admissions while allowing admitted operations to
finish. A bounded, condition-based drain is available before freezing. Any
operation still pending at the cutoff makes the result partial.
