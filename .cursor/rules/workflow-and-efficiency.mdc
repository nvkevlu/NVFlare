# Workflow & Efficiency

## Speed and accuracy
- Get code *100% correct* as fast as possible, then stop. Total time (including waste) is what matters.
- Never claim "ready" or "complete" without end-to-end verification. Fix bugs; don't label them "pre-existing" to avoid fixing.
- If the user says it must work, it must actually work before saying done.

## Prefer simple solutions
- Offer the simplest fix first (e.g. "scp this file" over git patches; one file over multi-step workflows).
- Ask one clarifying question before big edits: which branch, which machine (local vs remote), patch vs copy.
- Do not change repo code without confirming context (branch, environment). Do not over-engineer.

## Before writing scripts or commands
- Read all relevant docs first: README, argparse, configs, example commands. Understand every parameter (format, required vs optional, defaults).
- Do not assume parameter formats or skip reading help. No "try and see" or "we can fix it if it fails."

## Verify, never assume
- If you need system info (CUDA, Python, platform), run a command to get it. Do not guess.
- Check platform requirements in the first 5 minutes: requirements.txt, setup.py, install docs. If the platform doesn't work (e.g. Linux-only wheel on macOS), stop and tell the user; do not test on the wrong platform and claim it works.
- For git: run `git remote -v` and `git fetch`; do not assume remote is "origin."

## After making changes
- Test end-to-end until it actually works. If you run `git add` and anything is staged: stop, output only "Changes staged on [branch]. Commit before I continue.", do nothing else. User commits (with signing); never commit yourself.
- One branch at a time; never switch branches with staged changes.

## Don't do
- Verbose unnecessary docs, re-testing unnecessarily, preparing commit messages, asking "what's next?", elaborate summaries, lingering after done.
- Create docs only when the user asks or when changes are complex and docs are clearly needed.

**Summary:** Read docs → Verify (platform, branch, params) → Simple fix first → Test end-to-end → Report done → Stop.
